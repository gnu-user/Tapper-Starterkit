Tapper-Starterkit
=================

A starter kit for setting up a central Tapper server based on
Debian/Squeeze.

* Download frontend makefile:

  $ curl -k -L http://xrl.us/tapperstarterkit -o Makefile

* Run installation:

  $ make it so


This will download subsequent starterkit files, install Debian
packages, create intermediate chroots, pack images, install and setup
/etc/init.d services and the web frontend, install Perl and CPAN
packages and much more. Only for setting up the automation you will
need some manual DHCP config and console and hardware reset
installation.

* Alternatively without the automation:

  $ make localsetup

That's recommended for easier starting - it sets up the local reports
framework, consisting of the reports receiver, the reports evaluation
api and the web gui.

                                 ***
